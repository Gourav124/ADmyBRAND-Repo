## AI Tools Used
- Primary tools: Chatpgpt, Bolt.new
- Key use cases: I used Bolt.new to generate the UI and starter code for a responsive web application. ChatGPT was mainly used for debugging issues in VS Code, understanding errors, and refining the code structure when needed.
## Sample Prompts 
1. Create a web application using above sections which is suitable for desktop, tablet and mobile.(I give this prompt after copy-pasting given landing page sections).
2. Give a name to website "ADmyBRAND AI Suite" - our fictional AI-powered marketing tool.

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- AI-generated: 90% | The UI layout, HTML/CSS/JS/React code templates, and overall structure of the application were generated using Bolt.new and enhanced using ChatGPT.
- Manual coding: I manually debugged and fixed code errors, handled deployment to Netlify, and pushed the final code to GitHub. I also made responsive design tweaks and configuration changes not handled by the AI.
- Customization: I slightly modified the AIâ€™s suggestions to better fit my project and made sure the final submission matched the task guidelines.
